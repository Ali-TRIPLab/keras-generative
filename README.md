Keras VAEs and GANs
===

> Keras implementation of various deep generative networks such as VAE and GAN.

## Models

* Variational autoencoder (VAE)
* Generative adversarial network (GAN or DCGAN)
* Energy-based GAN (EBGAN)

## Usage

Example programs are included in ``examples`` directory. These programs can be used as

```shell
python examples\train_dcgan.py --epoch 200 --batchsize 100 --output output
```
